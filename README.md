## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Through this exercise, I understood the importance of setting {margin: auto} to target divs in CSS especially after initializing margin as 0 at the root html level.

I however noticed that the webpage viewed differently in chrome (Below!) when compared with firefox (Above!)

This project was carried out with a mobile-first approach. The picture below shows the camparison of the exercise as given in the frontend Mentor site and The outlook of my project in mobile view

### Continued development

I hope to find and reduce redundant code in the css file.
In the nearest future, Will create a series where I attempt 20 more frontend Mentor challenges in another git repository. This I believe will help me grasp the importance of more concepts in html, css and javascript.
